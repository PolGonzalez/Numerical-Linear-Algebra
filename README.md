This is a list of programs that solve problems related with matrices. One does the LU decomposition of a matrix and is able to compute the inverse of a matrix. Others include iterative methods to solve linear systems. There are also some other programs to do the LU decomposition in a much faster way if the matrix is (almost) diagonal.
